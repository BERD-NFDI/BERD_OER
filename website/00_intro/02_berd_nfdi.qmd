The association **Nationale Forschungsdateninfrastruktur (NFDI)** is a nationwide initiative in Germany that aims to systematically organize, make accessible, and sustainably preserve research data across disciplines. By providing standards, tools, and services for research data management, the NFDI strengthens open science and ensures that valuable data can be reused in the long term. News and updates about the NFDI initiative can be found on the [NFDI website](https://www.nfdi.de/).

BERD@NFDI is one of the discipline-specific consortia within the NFDI. It focuses on data and research methods from the fields of **Business, Economic, and Related Data (BERD)**. The consortium brings together universities, research institutes, and infrastructure providers to develop community-driven solutions for collecting, managing, and reusing complex and sensitive data in these domains.
