Recognizing the type of data you’re working with is crucial. It determines how you can summarize it, visualize it, and extract meaningful insights.

Each row typically represents an observation, and each column represents a variable or feature. This format is one of the most common in data analysis and is used in tasks like regression, classification, and exploratory data analysis. Examples include survey results, financial records, and experiment logs.\n\n#### Text {#text}\n\nText data includes any data in written language, ranging from short phrases to full documents. It can come from diverse sources such as interviews, survey responses, articles, or social media posts. In some cases, text may need to be extracted from other formats, such as PDFs, with more information on data wrangling available in the section on [PDFs](01_wrangling.qmd#pdfs). Analyzing text often involves preprocessing steps like tokenization, and tasks may include sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or text classification, for which more detail can be found on the [NLP](../03_ml/02_nlp.qmd) page. \n\n#### Visual {#visual}\n\nVisual data includes images, videos, and other forms of visual representations that convey information through patterns, shapes, or spatial structure.

Key methods include forecasting, anomaly detection, and trend analysis.\n\n#### Network Data {#network_data}\nNetwork data represents relationships or interactions between entities, often visualized as graphs with nodes (entities) and edges (connections).
